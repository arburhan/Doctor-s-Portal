### Description
Doctor's Portal is a dentist related website. Once a user logs in here he will be able to make appointments as per his wish, but will not be able to take slots twice on the same subject in the same day. The user will be able to view his appointment and make payment. When an admin logs in, he will be able to view the web site differently. There is a separate dashboard for him. If you want admin, you can add admin to general user, you can add doctor. Every effort has been made to make the whole web site responsive and user friendly. I hope you enjoy watching it live.
